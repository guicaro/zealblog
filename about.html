Hello. Hola! नमस्ते. કેમ છો? Zeal means enthusiasm, and yes, this is the real name that my mother looked up in the dictionary and ensured that it complied with my Indian astrological birth sign. A <a href="https://www.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Duke University</a> and <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">UT Austin</a> graduate, where I also had the honor to teach yoga. I am a zealous and inquisitive student of life who gave up an international corporate job for sharing about yoga, discovering beautiful handcrafted items and living in a mindful way. I have worked in three continents, speak four languages, and want to help by sharing the little yet incredible knowledge and experiences that life has generously gifted me.
      </p>

I started with yoga when I was 10 years old and recently got certified in India as a yoga teacher at the world’s oldest, <a href="https://theyogainstitute.org/" target="_blank">The Yoga Institute</a>. My quest for exploration over the years has connected me with a myriad of programs and teachers. As a sadhaka (seeker of ‘truth’), I am currently pursuing the <a href="http://www.himalayanyogatradition.com/" target="_blank">Himalayan Tradition</a> Teacher Transformation Program that traces its lineage to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shankara" target="_blank">Adi Shankaracharya</a>.
