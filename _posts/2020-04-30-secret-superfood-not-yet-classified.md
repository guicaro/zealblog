### Steps to germinate mung beans 
1. Soak overnight 
2. Remove the water next morning
3. Take a thin cotton piece of cloth or napkin and loosely wrap the mung
4. Make sure the mung and cloth stay slightly humid 
5. Wait 24 to 48 hours (warmer climates will accelerate the germination process)
6. Monitor and wait till the beans sprout a 1 to 2 inch tail (longer tails will take more time) 
7. Rinse and eat 

My hubby was surprised to discover mung bean sprouts on one of our trips to India! Quickly, he became a big fan and even his nutritionist highly approved after researching about this secret superfood. A staple for our breakfast or even cooked for lunch, theyâ€™re becoming increasingly popular and can be found in many natural food stores across the world.
