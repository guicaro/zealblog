Here is the summary: 
Ayurveda means science of life. Ayu - Life, Veda - science. It is holistic (mind, body, soul and emotions are connected)
Three Doshas (tendencies):
1. **Vata** (ether, air, variable appetite)
2. **Kapha** (earth, water, weak appetite)
3. **Pitta** (fire, water, strong appetite)
COVID-19 starts out as infection in Vata and then develops into Kapha and Pitta
 
Steps for prevention during COVID-19
1. Maintain a routine and excellent personal hygiene
2. Cover head, ears, neck, eyes, and feet whenever outside by using scarves, jackets, and dupattas
3. Prevent the body from touching or being touched as much as possible. Don't touch face with unclean hands
4. Leave shoes outside the house
5. Bathe with hot water and change clothes after entering the house
6. Light camphor to purify air and calm the mind in the morning and evening
7. Ayurveda and yoga go hand in hand. Practice yoga (meditation, deep breathing, and relaxation)
8. Do not overeat; eat only when hungry
9. Practice social isolation and quarantine as much as possible
10. Be calm and stay strong
 
Foods to strengthen immunity
1. Spices and hot foods/drinks balance vata and kapha
2. Drink warm water
3. Do warm salty water gargles
4. Make a concoction with long pepper, ginger powder, turmeric, cinnamon and honey to consume early in the morning
5. Massage sesame or coconut oil on the joints daily
6. Eat 1 tbsp chyavanprash (cooked mixture of sugar, honey, ghee, Indian gooseberry (amla) jam, sesame oil, berries and various herbs and spices)
7. Use turmeric, cinnamon, basil, dry ginger, and other spices in cooking
8. Guduchi/Giloy ghanavati/SamshamaniVati 500 mg. twice a day with warm water for 15 days to improve immunity and reduce fever
9. Anuthaila/ Sesame oil/cow ghee: 2 drops in each nostril daily in the morning (In case of nasal irritation, only swabbing the nostrils with Sesame oil may be done)
Note that these points are similar to the Ayurveda recommendations set forth by the Government of India in the [Advisory from the Ministry of AYUSH](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1609524&fbclid=IwAR3nlNCnwajPeFWgRhrZYLKe1UhqS_H1EMod53ineDvks_iErIbDouTpPRI "Ministry of Health and Family Welfare - Government of India")

Keep in mind that Ayurveda is an alternative holistic medicine. I hope that we can all benefit from this 5,000 year old science of life. Please know your personal limitations when trying anything novel and do not hesitate to let me know your thoughts or questions
