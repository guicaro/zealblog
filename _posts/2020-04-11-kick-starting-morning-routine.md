We like to start our mornings on an empty stomach with a 1.5-2 hour yoga asana/pranayama/meditation, followed by a homemade power breakfast of raw foods, seeds, and nuts that keeps us going for 4-5 hours.

| **The breakfast**  |

**Plant milk**: Just discovered for the first time how easy and yummy it is to make my own rice milk. Was tired of going through boxes of plant-based milks that tasted like watered-down cardboard. It is incredible to see how much cheaper, better-tasting, and eco-friendly this rice milk is! Just boil rice and blend it with water. [This recipe](https://simpleveganblog.com/homemade-rice-milk/ "Homemade Rice Milk") calls for dates as sweetener, which I skipped, and added some vanilla for flavoring. Also mixed some homemade coconut milk halfway through and it was heavenly.
 
**The trail mix**: Cashews, almonds, pecans, cranberries, raisins, goji berries, dates, pine nuts, cacao nibs, pumpkin seeds, and shredded coconut or any other seed or nut you can come up with.
 
**The protein powder**: Hemp, flaxseed powder, chia, pollen, black and white sesame seeds to keep refrigerated. I use it in my fruit bowl, curries, and also fresh-squeezed juices along with some amla powder for an additional Vitamin C boost.

**The Granola**: For the first time ever, also discovered the [best granola ever](https://cookieandkate.com/healthy-granola-recipe/ "The very best granola")...of course, it is homemade! No longer buying sugar-loaded, nutrient-deficient, cardboard-tasting cereal or granola! Itâ€™s so easy to make and you can get totally creative with your own mix of seeds/nuts/flavoring. I used rolled oats mixed with pressed wheat for this heavenly granola.
