      Overall Themes and Ideas of what yoga means to students<br><br>
      <b>Inner Peace and Emotional Regulation</b>: Words like peace, calm, peacefulness, reduce stress, happy place highlight yoga as a source of tranquility and mental restoration.<br><br>
      <b>Mind-Body Connection</b>: Phrases such as mind-body-breath connection, awareness, self-awareness, control, meditation show that students value yoga’s ability to unify physical and mental awareness.<br><br>
      <b>Balance and Harmony in Life</b>: Both literal and metaphorical balance are emphasized, reflecting yoga’s impact on stability and equilibrium. <br><br>
      <b>Strength and Flexibility</b>: Some students mention strength, flexibility, stretch, acknowledging the physical benefits of yoga.<br><br>
      <b>Spiritual and Personal Growth</b>: Words like connection with the spirit, reclaiming myself, self-care suggest that yoga supports personal and even spiritual transformation.<br><br>

We then flowed through warm ups, asanas (poses), pranayama (breath work), yoga Nidra (relaxation), and meditation. Towards the end of class while students had their eyes closed for relaxation, they found little surprises like incense sticks and fresh lemongrass bundles when they ‘woke’ up.
